### Configuration

Register .plp files in Windows to be opened automatically with `C:\plevi\printsrv.exe`  


### Special note

Please make sure, that wires are connected in same order over all installations.
Also make sure port mapping is identical everywhere.  

Even better
- create a document, where required wiring and port mapping is described and every time someone drives to point of sale to install the printers, give these instructions along.  
- label the wires. get a permanent marker or buy labeling machine
- take a photo of correctly connected wires at every POS

Thank us later.
